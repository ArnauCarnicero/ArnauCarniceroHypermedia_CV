<h2>Project analysis</h2>
<h3>User Profile</h3>
<p>My website is made as a personal CV, so the people I'm expecting to see it are employers, maybe directors of some project</p>
<h3>Information architecture</h3>
<p>In my website there are mainly 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li><div>
    <h4>Header</h4>
    <p>In the header there is my name, my photo and what i do, so the employer can recognise fastly that these is my CV. Is the part where the font-size is the biggest, so I capt the atention of the employer so maybe it will remember my name</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div>
    <h4>Main body</h4>
    <p>Here is where my most important information is located, my Experience and my Studies. In my Expirience I talk about my summer job and how long I have been doing it. Int the Studies section i talk about my career and again how long I have been doing it. The two sections are what I think the employer will consider when choosing a candidate</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div>
    <h4>Other Informations</h4>
    <p>At the left side there are other information that I think is less relevant but it could be good to consider., like the lanuages I speak and some skills I think I have. Also there are some personal information to contact me</p>
  </div></li>
</ol>
<h3>Visual design</h3>
<p>For the design I wnated to meake the website look clean and modern. The informations needs to be clear and understandable, it means no large texts, onley the meaningfull information. It has to be well delimitated, with headers on each section and spaced from each other.
The font choosen is one that makes easy to read the file. The onley variations on it are the size, wich indicates the relevance information. Also  some especific information are written in italics, such as dates or the level of the languages.
The colors neaded to be onley three:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the background of the text I have chosen a darck gray, easy to watch so it doesen't blind the reader if it has in case you have the maximum brightness set. It also helps to make the website look more modern</li>
  <li>For the text I used the white color, in contrast with the black background</li>
  <li>To delimitate some sections I used crimson rectangles to not make the document monochromatic</li>
</ul>
